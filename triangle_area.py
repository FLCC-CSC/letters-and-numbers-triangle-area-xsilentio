########################################

'''

1. What is the flow of the program? Which line of code kicks off the process?

The program starts by asking the user for input, this is represented in the first line of code. 



2. What was the hardest part of this lab?

No part was hard, though it wasn't instantly obvious which way to write the program was best -- whether to use an f-string or a + or a comma in the print statement; whether to convert the input into the int vs. float, etc.
